# GRCon22 CTF challenges

This repository contains the material used to prepare the challenges that I
submitted to the GRCon22 CTF, as well as solutions for the SETI challenge (which
was one of the challenges I submitted) and the Never the same color track (by argilo).

For more details, see my [write-up](https://destevez.net/2022/10/grcon22-capture-the-flag/).
